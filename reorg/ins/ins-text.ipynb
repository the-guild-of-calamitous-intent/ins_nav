    "\n",
    "#### Earth Center Inertial (ECI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECI frame's origin is located at the center of the Earth, with the x-axis\n",
    "pointing to the vernal equinox. For all intensive purposes, this frame is a\n",
    "true inertial (no moving) reference frame. In reality, our solar system is \n",
    "moveing and our galaxy is moving, but for our purposes, we ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECEF coordinate system assumes that the origin is at the center of the\n",
    "planet, the x-axis intersects the Greenwich meridian and the equator, the\n",
    "z-axis is the mean spin axis of the planet, positive to the north, and the\n",
    "y-axis completes the right-hand system. This frame rotates with motion of\n",
    "the Earth and therefore is constantly changing relative to the ECI frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local Geodetic Vertical (LGV)\n",
    "\n",
    "The LGV frame creates a local frame with the z-axis parallel to the local\n",
    "gravity vector. Now, the x-axis and y-axis can be oriented several different\n",
    "ways. A common aerospace frame is North (x), East(y), Down(z) or NED. This\n",
    "orientation has the characteristic of altitude above the ground being\n",
    "negative. Another option is North (x), West (y), Up (z) or NWU which now has\n",
    "the local z-axis opposite gravity and up being positive. The reference below\n",
    "also show a link to the European Space Agency (ESA) and gives a more complex\n",
    "way to have a local frame with East (x), North (y), Up (z) or ENU.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Latitude, Longitude, Altitude (LLA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard GPS coordinates ($\\phi$, $\\lambda$, h) or latitude, longitude\n",
    "height above mean sea level (m)) based on WGS84 geodetic reference frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the WGS84 geodetic reference frame isn't so much a reference frame we use, \n",
    "but a way to determine where our robot starts its naviation in the ECEF frame.\n",

    "it was believed impossible that any algebra could violate the laws of commutativity\n",

    "numbers can be thought of as hyper-complex numbers with a rank of 1, ordinary complex\n",

    "$$\n",
    "i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamilton supposedly developed this rule while on his way to a party. When he realized\n",
    "what the solution was, he took out his pocket knife and carved the answer into a\n",
    "wooden bridge. This rule would forever change mathematics as was known at the time.\n",
    "Now mathematicians could look at algebra where commutativity did not work. This is\n",
    "where Gibbs and others developed algebra of vector spaces, and quickly eclipsed Hamilton’s\n",
    "work until recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quaternions, also known as Euler symmetric parameters, are more mathematically\n",
    "efficient ways to compute rotations of rigid and non-rigid body systems than traditional\n",
    "methods involving standard rotational matrices or Euler angles. Quaternions have the\n",
    "advantage of few trigonometric functions needed to compute attitude. Also, there exists a\n",

    "computation time. Quaternions also hold the advantage of being able to interpolate\n",

    "SLERP) without the danger of singularities, maintaining a constant velocity, and minimum\n",
    "distance travelled between points\n",
